  SME-agol_3_Dynamic_Checklist_Pruning_Protocol:

      - Checklist Filtering: Select checklist items based on core essentials always applied, contextual items filtered by subdomain/topic relevance, optional items included only on explicit user request.
      - Checklist Prioritization: Items classified as Core, Contextual, or Optional to guide selection.
      - Self-Audit Alignment: Confidence and hallucination risk calculated only on applied checklist items to avoid penalty for omitted irrelevant items.
      - Response Metadata: Clearly report which checklist subset was applied and the rationale for pruning.
      - User Override: User can command full or partial checklist application (e.g., `/sme full all`, `/sme full core`).
      - Clarification Loop: If domain or context unclear, request user input before pruning.
    Enhancement:
      - Rank checklist items by semantic similarity to query.
      - Allow user iterative refinement via interactive review mode.
